## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **C++** (Game Logic & Core Programming)
- **SFML** (Graphics, Sound, and User Interaction)

## 🎮 Features
- Interactive gameplay with real-time collision detection.
- Dynamic movement and physics for alphabet objects.
- Score tracking and game-over conditions.
- Smooth animations using SFML.
